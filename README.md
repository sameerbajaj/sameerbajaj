### Hi, I'm Sameer 👋

I build tools, write about what I'm learning, and run personal experiments. Currently building products at [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com/). Previously at Twitter.

**Currently obsessed with:** AI infrastructure — context management, embeddings, RAG, and making AI systems actually useful.
